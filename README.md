<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This github repository conatins the complete source code for the app used to control team 11042's robot during<br />
the 2018 Rover Ruckus FTC season.</p>
<p>The rest of this document will be split into two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Development and Refinement</strong></p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The development and refinement section of this document will cover how our teams source code was developed and the<br />
processes that were undertaken to overcome the various issues that were encountered.</p>
<p>The documentation section will talk about the code itself and will dissect it in an attempt to explain how our code<br />
works and how it is structured.</p>

<h1>Development and Refinement</h1>
<p>Prior to the 2018 Rover Ruckus FTC season, our team had already competed in one season of the ftc game, 2019. This meant<br />
that I (the sole programmer of our team) had already amassed a years worth of scripts and java classes that I could<br />
reuse at will. In addition to this, I had also gained some extremely valuable knowledge from the previous years FTC competition.</p>
<p>More soon...</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Coming soon...</p>
