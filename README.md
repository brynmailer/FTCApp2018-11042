<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This github repository conatins the complete source code for the app used to control team 11042's robot during the 2018 Rover Ruckus FTC season.</p>
<p>The rest of this document will be split into two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Development and Refinement</strong></p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The development and refinement section of this document will cover how our teams source code was developed and the processes that were undertaken to overcome the various issues that were encountered. The documentation section will talk about the code itself and will dissect it in an attempt to explain how our code works and how it is structured.</p>

<h1>Development and Refinement</h1>
<p>Prior to the 2018 Rover Ruckus FTC season, our team had already competed in one season of the ftc game, 2019. This meant that I had already amassed a years worth of scripts and java classes that I could reuse at will. In addition to this, I had also gained some extremely valuable knowledge from the previous years FTC competition.</p>
<p>After seeing all of the omni-directional robots at the last FTC nationals in sydney, I knew that this year I definitely wanted to have a drive system that could allow our robot the full range of horizontal translation while also being able to maintain a constant heading. This desire led me to spend a good chunk of the time before this year's competition programming and revising this system. In the end </p>
<p>More soon...</p>

<p>Coming soon...</p>
